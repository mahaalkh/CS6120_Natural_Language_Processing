# Comments start at a hash (#) character and go to the end of the line.
# Ignore lines that only have whitespace.

# All other lines should have a non-negative weight, a left-hand-side
# nonterminal symbol, and one or more right-hand-side terminals and
# nonterminals.

# The start symbol is START.
# These two rules are required; choose their weights carefully!
# If S1 is chosen, the generator will use your human-written grammar.
# If S2 is chosen, the generator will use a tag bigram model.

# We start the weight for S2 at 0 so that you can play around with
# generating sentences from your grammar without being confused by the
# bigram model.

## End of human-written grammar

## Vocabulary section
# This is a hand-generated set of preterminal rules.
# It specifies a simple tag set which will be handled by the S2
# grammar and which can (though doesn't necessarily need to be)
# handled by the S1 grammar.

# The weights and left-hand-side tags given here may be changed, but
# no new vocabulary items are to be added. That keeps you from
# stumping other parsers simply by adding new words.

# Miscellaneous items that don't fit into any of our simple tags are
# given to Misc.  You will want to develop your own tags for these!


# Singular and mass nouns.  Notice that only the
# ones that start with consonants get our Noun tag.
